Note: This documentation is related to the DSR/CORTEX **components**. You can find the DSR/CORTEX related **library** in robocomp repository ([libs/dsr](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/development/libs/dsr)) with some developer documentation to use the APIs and UIs.

# Description
CORTEX is a long term effort to build a series of architectural designs around the simple idea 
of a group of agents that share a distributed, dynamic representation acting as a working memory.
This data structure is called **Deep State Representation (DSR)** due to the hybrid nature 
of the managed elements, geometric and symbolic, and concrete (laser data) and abstract (logical predicates).
A CORTEX instance is a set of software components, called _agents_, that share a distributed data structure called (_G_)raph playing the role of a working memory. Agents are C++ programs that can be generated using RoboComp's code generator, _robocompdsl_.

<sup>*The illustration shows a possible instance of the CORTEX architecture. The central part of the ring contains the **DSR graph** that is shared by all agents, from whom a reference implementation is presented here. Coloured boxes represent agents providing different functionalities to the whole. The purple box is an agent that can connect to the real robot or to a realistic simulation of it, providing the basic infrastructure to explore prediction and anticipation capabilities*</sup>


# Installation
&#x1F534; Attention: these are not instructions to install DSR!  
&#x1F534; Check the [libs/dsr](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/development/libs/dsr) documentation for specific instructions on the installation of the needed infrastructure. 


To install these components in this repository it's assumed that you have already installed [robocomp](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/development/README.md#installation-from-source).
You must clone this (dsr-graph) repository in ~/robocomp/components/
```sh
cd ~/robocomp/components/
git clone https://github.com/robocomp/dsr-graph/
cd dsr-graph/components/
```
  
  Note: In Ubuntu 20.04 you need to replace the file in 
   ```sh
  sudo cp TriangleFunctor /usr/include/osg
  ```
  
  Note: To compile some agents you need g++-10.2 and change the directive
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17) to set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
  but then you'll get a compilation error in one of ZeroC's Ice include files. Please, replace it with:
  ```sh
  sudo cp Connection.h /usr/include/Ice/Connection.h
  ```

# Basic use case

Goto to this [tutorial](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/development/doc/DSR-start.md) where you can follow several use cases of increasing complexity.
