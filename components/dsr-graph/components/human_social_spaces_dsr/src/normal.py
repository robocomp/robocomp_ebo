        Calculates the contribution to a normal distribution of an observation at
        a given location and dimension, based on the standard deviation vector and
        the mean vector.

        Args:
            grids (ndarray (N-dimensional array).): 2D or 3D grid of discrete
                points that are used to compute the Gaussian kernel density estimate.
                
                		- `grids[0]` and `grids[1]`: These are the grid points in the
                3D space, where `grids[0]` represents the coordinates of the point
                on the x-axis, `grids[1]` represents the coordinates of the point
                on the y-axis, and `grids[2]` represents the coordinates of the
                point on the z-axis.
                		- `_mu`: A 3x3 matrix representing the mean position of the
                distribution in the 3D space. The matrix has three rows and three
                columns, with each element representing a coordinate in the 3D space.
                		- `self._sigma`: A 3x3 matrix representing the covariance of the
                distribution in the 3D space. The matrix has three rows and three
                columns, with each element representing a square of the standard
                deviation at a particular coordinate in the 3D space.
                		- `_dimensions`: An integer representing the number of dimensions
                in the 3D space, which is either 3 (for a full 3D space) or 2 (for
                a plane in 3D space).
                
                	The `addTo` function then performs the following operations based
                on the input `grids`:
                
                		- For a 3D space: Computes the distance between each grid point
                and the mean position, and squares the result to obtain the squared
                distances. Then, computes the exponent of the distances using the
                covariance matrix and normalizes the result.
                		- For a 2D space: Computes the distance between each grid point
                and the mean position in the x-y plane, squares the result, and
                normalizes the result using the determinant of the covariance
                matrix and the distance between the mean positions in the x- and
                y-axes.
                
                	The resulting expression represents the probability density
                function of the distribution at the input `grids`.
            result (float): 1D or 2D random walker's probability density at a given
                point in space, and it is calculated using the Gaussian mixture
                model based on the grid positions, the mixutal parameters, and the
                dimension of the space.
