/**
 * @description Establishes a Web channel between a client and a server, handling
 * message passing between them. It defines an object with methods for sending/receiving
 * messages and properties.
 * 
 * @param { object } transport - transport object that is used to send messages between
 * the client and the server.
 * 
 * @param { `function`. } initCallback - initialization callback that is called with
 * the `channel` object as an argument after the necessary objects are created and
 * unwrapped properties are resolved, allowing the caller to perform any additional
 * setup or customization of the channel.
 * 
 * 		- `initCallback`: A callback function that is called after the QWebChannel's
 * initialization. It receives the channel object as its parameter and can be used
 * to perform any post-initialization tasks.
 * 
 * 	The `QWebChannel` class has several properties and methods to handle messages,
 * signals, responses, property updates, and debugging. The following are explained:
 * 
 * 		- `objects`: A hash table that maps object names to their respective QObject instances.
 * 		- `transport`: The transport object that is used to send and receive messages
 * over the channel.
 * 		- `send`: A method that sends a message to the channel. It takes a data payload
 * as its parameter, which can be a string or an JSON-serialized object.
 * 		- `onmessage`: A method that handles incoming messages on the channel. It takes
 * a message object as its parameter and processes it based on its type (signal,
 * response, property update, or debugging).
 * 		- `exec`: A method that executes a message callback function. It takes a data
 * payload as its parameter and schedules the callback function to be called with the
 * corresponding data parameter.
 * 		- `execCallbacks`: A hash table that maps message IDs to their respective callback
 * functions. These callbacks are called when a message is received on the channel.
 * 		- `objects`: A hash table that maps object names to their respective QObject instances.
 * 		- `handleSignal`: A method that handles incoming signals on the channel. It takes
 * a signal name and any argument objects as its parameters and calls the corresponding
 * signal emitted callback function.
 * 		- `handleResponse`: A method that handles incoming responses on the channel. It
 * takes a message ID and any response data as its parameters and calls the corresponding
 * response callback function.
 * 		- `handlePropertyUpdate`: A method that handles incoming property update messages
 * on the channel. It takes a hash table of signal IDs and any property updates as
 * its parameters and updates the properties of the corresponding QObject instances.
 * 		- `debug`: A method that sends a debugging message to the channel. It takes a
 * data payload as its parameter and logs it at the console.
 * 
 * @returns { object } a QWebChannel object with methods for sending messages, handling
 * signals and property updates, and unwrapping properties.
